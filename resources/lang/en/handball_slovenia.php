organization of handball in Slovenia, the Handball Federation of Slovenia, which is currently chaired by Mr.
Franjo Bobinac.
                        <br><br>The federation was established at the end of 1949 as part of what was then the Handball Federation of
Yugoslavia. Its first president was Vlado Žorž, meanwhile, at that time there were already six handball clubs
in Slovenia: Kladivar (Celje), Polet (Maribor), Enotnost (Ljubljana) and three others from Ptuj, Lendava and
Murska Sobota. Gaining more and more recognition, Slovenia had already more than 100 official clubs in
1975. The first national handball championship took place in 1949. Six teams participated and the team
from Celje became the first national champion.
                        <br><br>Following Slovenia’s declaration of independence in 1991, the Handball Federation of Slovenia (HFS) also
became independent and a full member of the European (EHF) as well as the International Handball
Federation (IHF) the following year. During the 1991/92 season, the first national championship in the
independent Republic of Slovenia took place where Celje Pivovarna Laško won the men’s championship,
while the women’s title went to the Belinka Olimpija handball club. Later on, national teams in different
categories and age groups were starting to form and compete in European and world championship,
meanwhile, it was the 1992/93 season in which Slovenian handball clubs made their debut in the European
Handball Federations’ European Cup.'
