and organizing business activities, which are held as side events in the margins of major sporting
competitions. In a wish to present and promote Slovenia as an integrated whole through major handball
championships, the Handball Federation of Slovenia, in cooperation with several Slovene partners, set up
the Slovenia Center – I feel Slovenia project. This Center is established to stimulate business and social
networking and represents the point of business, cultural, social, media and sports gathering.
                        <br><br>
                        The purpose of organizing and establishing this Center is to ensure an effective promotion of Slovenia, the
Slovenian economy as well as to boost business cooperation with the host country of the championship and
all other interested countries. The objective of the Slovenia Center is (1) to establish a cooperation network
between the Slovenian business entities and the business and economic entities from the host country,
along with other interested countries, (2) to comprehensively promote Slovenia, (3) to bring together the
Slovenian and foreign interested public under one roof through a major handball event (such as a world or
European championship).
                        <br><br>
                        The business part of the “Slovenia Center – I feel Slovenia” project intertwines with the second segment of
the project – the Fanzone –, a place dedicated especially to supporters of the Slovenian national handball
team where they can socialize and interact while rooting for the Slovenian national team at various
international sporting events.
                        <br><br>
                        In cooperation with other Slovenian business partners, the Slovenian Handball Federation already launched
and realized the “Slovenia Center – I feel Slovenia” project during the 2015 World Men’s Handball
Championship Cup in Qatar and the 2016 European Men’s Handball Championship in Poland. The project,
on a smaller scale, was also set up in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) during the 2016 summer Olympic Games. Based
on the widespread positive feedback received and business partnerships created, the project analysis
following the first two realisations – in Doha (Qatar) and Wroclaw (Poland) – showed that the business
community approved our project and considered it to be exceptional. In light of this positive outcome, the
Slovenian Handball Federation decided to organize and set up a “Slovenia Center – I feel Slovenia center” in
Croatia as well.'

Croatia. The championship presents itself as an excellent opportunity for the promotion of the country, not
only in terms of sport but in terms of business as well. As a country of exciting new opportunities and
successful business stories, Slovenia is without a doubt able to efficiently promote its diversity with flying
colors. With this in mind, it is important that we as a country stay together as an integrated whole, and
present ourselves in a tactful, professional and affable manner. Slovenia is a land of charming, hardworking
and open-minded people. A welcoming country of blooming and prosperous business opportunities for
businesses and other entities from all corners of the world. There is no doubt that we could use the same
eulogistic description for our neighboring country Croatia, as well. While business cooperation between
these two countries is already thriving, we believe that it could be even stronger and brought to greater
heights.

budding the Croatian business environment really is. Numerous Slovenian companies have already seized
this opportunity, yet a plethora of business opportunities remains, which can only strengthen our
cooperation. In the light of this, we believe that a major sporting event such as a European handball
championship is an impeccable chance for us to establish and tighten relations between Croatian and
Slovenian companies. An event like this is of significant importance for the promotion of Slovenia and
everything that Slovenia stands for – from its business and entrepreneurial environment, tourism and
culture to its sports, people, knowledge, and so much more.

Zagreb, the Slovenia Center - I feel Slovenia is comprised of two parts; on one hand, it is a business center
