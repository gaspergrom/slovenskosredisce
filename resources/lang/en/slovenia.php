Republic of Slovenia takes up a small part of Central Europe. It is bordered by Italy, Austria, Hungary and
Croatia. In 2004, Slovenia became an official member state of the European Union, following which it
became part of the Schengen area and adopted the official currency of the Eurozone – the euro.
                        <br><br>
                        Built on the remains of the Roman Empire, Slovenia’s capital Ljubljana is the cultural and political
metropolis of the country. Boasting with a strategic position and a beautiful, pristine and diverse landscape,
Slovenia is an important transit point and a destination of blooming tourism. Despite its diminutive size,
Slovenia’s scenery is multifarious and breathtaking. The Slovenian population of only 2 065 000 inhabitants
is united through its language, Slovene – which still uses the dual grammatical number form –, its national
consciousness and culture, a passionate love for nature and a wish to preserve and keep it green and
unspoiled. An area of outstanding national beauty, 8% of Slovenia’s nature is protected and part of a
national park, while forests cover more than 58% of the country and crystal-clear and emerald-green
waters flow through it, providing numerous animal and plant species with a natural habitat.'

        'text'  => 'The Slovenian business environment has some significant competitive advantages. First and foremost,
Slovenia’s geostrategic and logistic position, coupled with a highly skilled and educated workforce, presents
a land of opportunity for investors. Slovenia is the bridge between the Balkans and West Europe, while the
port of Koper enables quality logistic services and connection into Central Europe, as well. Experts assessed
that Slovenia’s low prices of input raw materials, which they import from the Balkans and East Europe, are
also a major asset. The European Commission is projecting an impressive 3.1% growth rate for 2017 and
2018, while the growth outlook for the rest of the Eurozone is around 1.9%. One key contributor to the high
economic growth in 2017 is most definitely the considerable rise of exports. According to official data, the
biggest exporters are Krka, Gorenje and Lek, which jointly export several billion of their products each year.

                        In the past years, Slovenia has been successfully eliminating business and technical barriers, thus rendering
its business environment more efficient, and at the same time enabling future investors a simple and
secure way to establish a company – via the single entry point, E-vem. The SPIRIT Slovenia Public Agency for
Entrepreneurship, Internationalization, Foreign Investments and Technology (<a href="http://www.spiritslovenia.si" target="_blank"

have cultivated developed land in industrial sites, providing rapid access to business activity premises.'

intertwined in folk customs, a haute cuisine, a complex language and vernacular architecture, coupled with
its breathtaking pristine nature and environment, make Slovenia a must-stop for every wanderlust
wanderer wishing to just stop and stare at its natural beauty. Slovenia’s cities, of which some date back to
even before the Roman Empire, serve as proof of the country’s cultural multifariousness. With an open
heart and free spirit, the hospitable Slovenian villagers are the glue which keep our alpine country together

and give it the true and vivid essence, which makes Slovenia the unique and exceptional land as we know it.
Distant snow-capped Alpine peaks, emerald-green rivers, jaw dropping underground caves, the blue
Mediterranean Sea, astonishing panoramas, full-bodied fine wine… Slovenia has it all.
